flag{CONVOKUTION_FUJ7WWEc5N}

If you zoom in really hard you can see the very light text "flag{"the string you will get"_FUJ7WWEc5N}"
intervals of colored text translates => "key"
distinguishing font sizes and double spaces as "large" characters translates => bacon cipher => mslfsjexgyr
using the above info you plug it into a Vigenere decoder => CONVOKUTION
you now have the flag, hoorah
